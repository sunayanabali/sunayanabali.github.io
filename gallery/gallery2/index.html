In the basement below Chelsea Market, is a new art exhibit that is in a historic buildings massive boiler room. Their inaugural installation is a trippy "synesthetic reality experiment" involving more than 300 million images that cover the walls and floor, swirling around and melting and blowing your mind. The piece is meant to explore the near future. The visuals illustrate a narrative of a machine learning and ultimately dreaming. The music that accompanies the images was composed using samples of radio transmissions and pieces from sound archives of taxis and other city sounds.</p>
<p>While I was there, I went and saw the upper level balcony bar where the menu is infused with technology as well. 'The Augmented reality cocktail' they called it. This was my favorite Artwork-ish. To get a drink you needed to download the Artechouse application on a smartphone, the bar's drinks and coasters come to life with augmented reality. Scanning the logo on the bar's coasters pulled up a digital version of the menu to help you to choose from. and moving the phone around, would create an augmented reality version of your drink to see as you enjoy the drink. Its form was a glass, that played its function through the use of augmented reality. The goal of Augmented Reality is to create a system in which the user cannot tell the difference between the real world and the virtual augmentation of it.</p>
