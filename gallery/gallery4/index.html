The Eden Fine Art Gallery is a three floored Art gallery located in Soho. One of the exhibits that was showcased was, David Kracov, his sculptures that burst with color and excitement, warming the onlooker's heart intrigued me. The explosive motifs that escape from his art emit huge, positive energy that has charmed audiences across the globe. David Kracov's breathtaking sculpture entitled 'The Book of Life' really did give me butterflies.

<p>
Its form was a metal sculpture inspired by the extraordinary life of Rabbi Yossi Raichik, a man who saved thousands of children's lives from the devastating effects of the Chernobyl disaster. Each of the hand-painted butterflies represents the 2547 children that escaped Chernobyl's nuclear disaster and, with the help of the charity, have been given a chance at a new life. The pages looked like a manuscript to me at first, but when I looked closer and read about it, they were pages filled with poems, and songs, written by children who died at Auschwitz, and one of them was a 13-year-old boy that wrote the poem.
He had a range of these showcased in the section of this gallery. Some other names were Ode to Art, Book of love and the notebook and several more. Each one had its own story, personally related to the artists experience and hobbies.
This one stood out to me as the form and function went well together as a tribute story. Celebrating the life with colors and butterflies was really a winner for me. </p>
