<div class="box1">
<p> On a rainy day in New York, I walked into the David Zwirner Gallery, to come across an opening of a new exhibit by Yayoi Kusama, 'Every Day I Pray For Love'. Yayoi Kusama's art is fundamentally about obsession and the need, born of anxiety, to repeat certain acts in an attempt to free herself from that obsession. </p>

<p>From her famous dot works to large-scale installations, the artist explores her desire to escape from psychological trauma through an obsessive artistic vision. "Every day i pray for love" brings viewers into an encompassing environment that highlights the artist's style of art. It was 42 square canvases nearly all with "love," "beauty" or "splendor" in titles, that sounded like awkward haikus. They summon up images of suns, stones and small microscopic objects. Overall effect implying one of life and hope. On the same floor of that room are Kusama's "Clouds," a piece I feel stole the show, a dozen or so groups of stainless-steel sculptures that look like big blobs of mercury, or puddles of shiny tears. that implying the effect of Hope and despair and forcing the viewers to confront a distorted version of their ego: Who can't relate this confusion feeling? I thought this room had a loud atmosphere. </p>

<p>The other work that used the theme of confronting ourselves was the "Ladder to Heaven," featuring a ladder comprised of neon bars that change color, wrapped in a metal cage. The ladder extends from the floor to the ceiling, and mirrors at each end make it appear to go on infinite. Looking at the ladder elicits a powerful effect on the viewer: we are on the ladder of the universe, as it were, and it extends forever in either direction. We are small and insignificant, but there is always light and hope. </p>

<p><b>Her major question in this exhibit is,"how do we reckon with our complex creative identities - encompassing both biological and psychological aspects - while existing in a cold, dead, universe that operates far beyond what we think or do?"</b></p>

<center><h3>“My entire life has been painted in these paintings. Every day, any day. I will never cease dedicating my whole life to my love for the universe,” Kusama’s statement on the exhibit reads. “Oh my dearest art. With the challenge of creating new art, I work as if dying; these works are my everything.” <br>- Yayoi Kusama</h3></center>
