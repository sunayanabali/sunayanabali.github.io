	<p> This was a gallery that one of my friends took me too, and I found this gallery strangely interesting. One of the Exhibits was by a Young Desi Canadian Artist Maria Qamar, and her collection showcased called 'FRAAAANDSHIP!' Her work deals specifically with the realities of online interaction from a strong feminist perspective. Online communication, social media, and a sense of personal branding have changed, or at least complicated, the concept of friendship. She questions a further distortion of the term into "fraaaandship."</p>
<p>
In the Desi community, the use of the term "fraaaandship" on social media and communications apps such as Instagram, Whatsapp, and Facebook, takes on a sexual, and potentially shady connation. Offers of "fraaaandship" often come totally unsolicited and are unwanted.  The exhibit was very inviting and engaging to go with friends and the Giant Samosa Bean Bag and 'Shiny Gold Maggi noodle Helium filled balloons' just stunned me and made me miss home. 
Her Style was graphic novel take, with speech bubbles set against yellow or red backgrounds. Laced with "Hinglish. Her offbeat soft sculptures, like the Giant Lota (Bidet) with "Shit Happens" and the Maggi noodle Balloons were my two favorites and intrigued me the most. Each one of them embodied candy-colored themes of sexism, cultural stereotypes, racism and trauma.

    <p> A lot of her large and colorful paintings had a rebellious and defiant spirit, refusing to conform to the rules and norms of the Desi culture, despite that it remains inviting and appealing. It takes a youthful, vibrant and pointed approach to contemporary issues facing women, particularly living in South Asian Communities. I found this interesting because although it wasn't directly relatable, it has been a prevailing part of my culture which I deeply conform too as well.</p>
