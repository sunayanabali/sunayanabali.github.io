<img src="imgs/ex3.png" style="width: 40vw;">
<div class="box1">
    <p> During One of our classes, i did a user test of my first attempt website to visualize and problem solve interactivity.<br> 
<b>
-The feedback i received was:<br>
-Distracting Background.<br>
-Lengthy Scrolling<br>
-Navigation at the end, for easier usability.<br>
</b>
I added a navigation to the bottom of the page as per feedback but still wasnt satisfied with my layout structure. I decided to experiment more and try to overcome my challenges.</p><br>

<h3> Excution 2 - Final </h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="box1">
    <p> 
       I created a layout that represented the style and structure of a lookbook, pages that flip through a timeline of decades, showcasing fashion style still prevelent and trending today. Through my website, i want users to be able to find their year of style and catch the modern trending alternative at a cheaper price. </p>

<!-- p>The iconography, and stylistic evolution of these remarkable objects was an eye-catching moment. I found myself coming back to one of the Vajachariya Priest's Crown originating back to 15th-16th Century, in which there was a lavish use of mercury gliding to convey the appearance of a golden object, enhanced with settings of turquoise and rock crystal, embellished with numerous, varied semiprecious stones such as Lapis Lazuli, Turquoise, which was used create a powerful triad for prosperity and protection. <br></p>

<p>All the applique elements, including the crowned Buddha's were modeled from repouss√© sheet metal. On this ornamental piece were 3 Buddha's at the front of the crown and one at the back. It was made out of copper and gold and was a grand object, that was purposefully worn in order to represent status and class than comfort. There was a separate room allocated to these artifacts, symbolizing a certain power held in these objects and the privacy the space evoked through its atmosphere. Having seen red associated with power, status and royalty in India, added an additional view on the surrounding of the chosen exhibit.</p>
